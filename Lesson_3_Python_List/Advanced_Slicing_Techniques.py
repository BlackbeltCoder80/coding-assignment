# 3. Advanced Slicing Techniques
# Objective: The aim of this assignment is to use Python list slicing.
# Problem Statement: You have a list of daily temperatures for one month, 
# and you'd like to extract specific data from it.
# 
# Task 1: Given the list of temperatures:
# 
temperatures = [72, 75, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 
                83, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 
                91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 
                98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 
                104, 105, 106]
print(temperatures[7:14])

print(temperatures[0:23])
# Extract the temperatures for the second week (7 days) of the month (index 7 to index 14). Expected Outcome:
# 83, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90,
# Task 2: Extract all the temperatures above 100. HINT: add the temperatures over 100 to a new list, 
# or use list slicing to get the temperatures.
# NOTE: Ensure that all code in your file is ready to run. 
# This means that if someone opens your file and clicks the run button at the top, all code executes as intended. 
# For example, if there are if statements or print statements, they should function correctly and display output in the console as expected.
# The goal of this note is to ensure that all code in your Python file runs smoothly and that is has been tested.
